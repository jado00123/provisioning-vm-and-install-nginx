# Provisioning VM Machine and Installing Nginx

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the process of provisioning a virtual machine (VM) and installing a basic Nginx web server on it. It covers the following key steps:

1. **VM Creation**: Setting up a virtual machine in a cloud environment.  
2. **SSH Access**: Connecting to the VM securely using SSH with private key authentication.  
3. **System Setup**: Updating packages and preparing the environment for installation.  
4. **Nginx Installation**: Installing Nginx web server on the VM.  
5. **Web Page Deployment**: Deploying a simple HTML page to verify that Nginx is running correctly.  
6. **Firewall Configuration**: Restricting access to the web server to authorized IPs (optional, depending on the environment).

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to practice **basic DevOps automation tasks**, understand **VM provisioning**, and get familiar with **deploying web services on a remote server**. It is a foundational project for those who want to learn **cloud management**, **server setup**, and **web deployment**.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Follow the instructions to connect to the VM using SSH.  
3. Run the setup commands or scripts to install Nginx and deploy the sample webpage.  
4. Open the VMâ€™s IP in a browser to confirm the web server is working.
